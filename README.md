# Terraforge
Terraforge is a platform designed for users to easily recycle, bid, and get paid out on Electronic waste. E-waste is a massive issue, with over 50 million tons of electronic waste generated annually. Terraforge creates a one-stop shop for users to recycle or sell their waste, and receive payouts for doing so.


As a user, you will be able to submit an item they would like to recycle or list for sale. Once the item is submitted, it will be listed on our database.

With future functionality, we plan to integrate an auction style system designed to create a strong and high demand app-based economy. Each item submitted will have a quantitative value backed on an ERC20 token, which you can redeem at any item once you have submitted an item to be recycled. If you opt to list it for sale, any user will be able to bid on items listed for sale in cash, and receive the token value in instead, at which point the user submitted will receive the cash value instead of tokens. This ensures the end user will still receive cash value or token value based bids received, and users without electronics can still invest and receive tokens through our auction style system.

Per financial quarter, Terraforge will allocate a set percentage of revenue generated from recycling users e-waste to burn the circulating supply of tokens, limiting volume and increasing value of each individual token.
